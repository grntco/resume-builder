# Resume Builder
This is a project for The Odin Project's React course [to create a resume/CV creator](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-cv-application) using React. 

This is the first website I built with React. I learned to work with reusable components, lists, and state. I also used Vite, CSS modules, Vercel (for hosting), and jsPDF (a library for converting HTML to PDF documents) for the first time.

**Live Demo:** [https://resume-builder-lac.vercel.app/](https://resume-builder-lac.vercel.app/)

## Features
* Input your info into the form cards and watch it automatically populate onto the resume document in real-time.
* If needed, you can add/delete work and education experiences—as well as add/delete responsibilities within each experience—up to specified limits.
* When finished, download your new resume using the button on the top right corner.
